jsonlight: json with rudimentary type encoding/decoding for Python
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Adds support for a couple of new Python magic methods to make Python object
oriented JSON encoding and decoding a bit easier, with the following goals in
mind:

- jsonlight.dumps should always work, even if it has to fallback to a string
- it detects if an object being dumped defines a ``__jsondump__`` method
- it detects if an object being dumped is of a type defined in the global
  typemap, or the one that's being used
- for complete round-tripping, the type schema is maintained in a
  ``__jsonload__`` method that you must implement

Standard types
--------------

This is what you can already do in Python:

.. code:: python

    from jsonlight import loads, dumps
    from uuid import UUID, uuid4

    obj = uuid4()
    assert obj == UUID(loads(dumps(str(obj))))

All standard Python types such as UUID must have an encode/decode method in the
default typemap provided by jsonlight, so encoding to JSON should always work.
However, the type must be specified on load:

.. code:: python

    from jsonlight import loads, dumps
    from uuid import UUID, uuid4

    obj = uuid4()
    assert obj == loads(UUID, dumps(obj))

You can see that the main difference with ``json.loads`` is that
``jsonlight.loads`` requires a type as first argument. This is because
``jsonlight.loads`` will first call ``json.loads`` to convert the string into a
Python object with basic JSON tyes, and then pass that to the type's
``__jsonload__`` function.

Nested types
------------

You may leverage the ``__jsondump__`` and ``__jsonload__`` methods based on the
following conventions:

- ``__jsondump__``: return a representation of self with JSON data types
- ``__jsonload__``: instanciate an object based on the result from __jsondump__

Example:

.. code-block:: python

    from jsonlight import load

    class YourClass:
        def __init__(self, uuid=None):
            self.uuid = uuid or uuid4()

        def __jsondump__(self):
            return dict(uuid=self.uuid)

        @classmethod
        def __jsonload__(cls, data):
            return cls(load(UUID, data['uuid'])

            # This also works, but would not illustrate how to support recursion
            # return cls(UUID(data['uuid']))

As you can see:

- you don't have to worry about calling ``__jsondump__`` on return values of
  your own ``__jsondump__`` because ``jsonlight.dumps`` will do that
  recursively,
- you have full control on deserialization just like with ``__setstate__``, but
  if you call jsonlight.load in there yourself then you don't have to
  duplicateÂ deserialization logic on nested objects,
